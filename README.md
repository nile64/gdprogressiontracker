# GD Progression Tracker
*I got of storing all my runs on a level in an inconvenient program such as google sheets, docs, or notepad so I made this.*

## What does it do?
This desktop application adds the ability to store all the information and runs you have on a level, and even give you nice statistics about them, while also keeping everything nice, clean, and easy to make changes to.

## Why should I use it?
It's a way better alternative to a notepad file or whatever you were probably using before. It also is very lightweight, not taking up much space on your PC at all. And as I've said before, it's very clean and very easy to use and change.
I will also frequently update this, unlike RobTop. I'll also always be up to hear about more things I could add to make this even better.

## How do I use it?
It's simple, just click a few self-explanatory buttons, follow the directions, input the correct things into the textboxes, and boom.
